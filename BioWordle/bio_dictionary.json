Eventually the neutral stimulus presented by itself produces a response (the conditional response , or conditioned reflex ) similar to that originally evoked by the biologically important stimulus. For example, Pavlov's dogs learned to salivate in response to the sound of a metronome that preceded the presentation of food. In instrumental (or operant ) conditioning the animal is rewarded (or punished) each time it makes a particular response; this eventually causes the frequency of the response to increase (or decrease). For example, a rat will learn to press a lever in order to obtain food. See reinforcement.",

The vertebrate heart has a thick wall ( see myocardium) composed of a specialized muscle ( see cardiac muscle); it is surrounded by the *pericardium. Mammals have a four-chambered heart consisting of two atria and two ventricles; the right and left sides are completely separate from each other so there is no mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood (see illustration). Oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins enters the heart through the left atrium, passes to the left ventricle, and leaves the heart through the *aorta. Deoxygenated blood from the *venae cavae enters the right atrium and is pumped through the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, which conveys it to the lungs for oxygenation. The tricuspid and bicuspid valves ensure that there is no backflow of blood. The contractions of the heart are initiated and controlled by the sinoatrial node ( see pacemaker); in an average adult human the heart contracts about 70 times per minute.

In mice and humans the set of antigens is determined by the *major histocompatibility complex (MHC) a complex cluster of genes. This encodes two distinct classes of histocompatibility antigens, both of which are glycoproteins. Class I antigens determine graft rejection and help cytotoxic *T cells recognize virus-infected cells. They are found on the surface of most cells in the body.

Each time a cell divides some sequences of the telomere are lost; eventually (after 60100 divisions in an average cell) the cell dies. Replication of telomeres is directed by telomerase , an enzyme consisting of RNA and protein that is inactive in normal cells. Its presence in tumours is linked to the uncontrolled multiplication of cancer cells.",
  "telophase": "A stage of cell division. In *mitosis the chromatids that separated from each other at *anaphase collect at the poles of the spindle. A nuclear membrane forms around each group, producing two daughter nuclei with the same number and kind of chromosomes as the original cell nucleus. In the first telophase of *meiosis, complete chromosomes from the pairs that separated at first anaphase form the daughter nuclei. The number of chromosomes in these nuclei is therefore half the number in the original one. In the second telophase, daughter nuclei are formed from chromatids (as in mitosis).",

Malnutrition can result from a reduced intake of nutrients ( undernourishment ), an inability to use absorbed nutrients, failure to meet a required increase in nutrient intake, or nutrient losses. There are three stages in the process of malnutrition: first, the carbohydrate stores in the body are depleted; secondly, the fat reserves are metabolized ( see fatty-acid oxidation); and finally, proteins are broken down to provide energy. Death may result after protein levels have been reduced to half their normal value. Kwashiorkor is a type of malnutrition that develops when the diet lacks proteins and hence *essential amino acids.

The problems associated with pesticides are that they are very often nonspecific and may therefore be toxic to organisms that are not pests; they may also be nonbiodegradable, so that they persist in the environment and may accumulate in living organisms ( see bioaccumulation). Organophosphorus insecticides, such as malathion and parathion, are biodegradable but can also damage the respiratory and nervous systems in humans as well as killing useful insects, such as bees.

  "cladogram": "A controversial method of classification in which animals and plants are placed into taxonomic groups called clades when they share characteristics (known as homologies ) that are thought to indicate common ancestry. It is based on the assumption that two new species are formed suddenly, by splitting from a common ancestor, and not by gradual evolutionary change. A diagram indicating these relationships (called a cladogram ) therefore consists of a system of dichotomous branches: each point of branching represents divergence from a common ancestor, as shown in the diagram. Thus the species A to F form a clade as they share the common ancestor X, and species A to D form a clade of a different taxonomic rank, sharing the ancestor X",

  "class": "A category used in the *classification of organisms that consists of similar or closely related orders. Similar classes are grouped into a phylum. Examples include Mammalia (mammals), Aves (birds), and Musci (mosses).",
  "classification": "The arrangement of organisms into a series of groups based on physiological, biochemical, anatomical, or other relationships. An artificial classification is based on one or a few characters simply for ease of identification or for a specific purpose; for example, birds are often arranged according to habit and habitat (seabirds, songbirds, birds of prey, etc.) while fungi may be classified as edible or poisonous. Such systems do not reflect evolutionary relationships. A natural classification is based on resemblances and is a hierarchical arrangement. The smallest group commonly used is the *species. Species are grouped into genera ( see genus), the hierarchy continuing up through *tribes, *families, *orders, *classes, and phyla ( see phylum) to *kingdom. (In traditional systems of plant classification the phylum was replaced by the *division.) Higher up in the hierarchy the similarities between members of a group become fewer. Present-day natural classifications try to take into account as many features as possible and in so doing aim to reflect evolutionary relationships ( see cladistics). Natural classifications are also predictive. Thus if an organism is placed in a particular genus because it shows certain features characteristic of the genus, then it can be assumed it is very likely to possess most (if not all) of the other features of that genus.

  "G-protein": "Any one of a group of proteins that have an important role in relaying signals in mammalian cells. They occur on the inner surface of the plasma membrane and transmit signals from hormone receptors on the outer surface of the cell to *adenylate cyclase, which catalyses the formation of the *second messenger, cyclic AMP, inside the cell. G-proteins bind to GTP and GDP ( see guanosine); the GTPprotein complex is able to activate adenylate cyclase, whereas the GDPprotein complex does not. Normally, deactivation of a G-protein is controlled by the hormone receptor on the cell surface and it also occurs as the GTP of a GTPprotein complex gradually hydrolyses to GDP. The cholera toxin exerts its effects by changing the G-protein in the epithelial cells of the intestine so that it is continually activated, which causes an abnormal increase in cellular adenylate cyclase levels. One consequence of this is that sodium ions are actively pumped into the intestine, causing water to follow by osmosis: the result is diarrhoea and dehydration.",

  "brewing": "The process by which beer is made. *Fermentation of sugars from barley grain by the yeasts * Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. uvarum (or S. carlsbergenesis ) produces alcohol (ethanol). In the first stage the barley grain is soaked in water, a process known as malting. The grain is then allowed to germinate and the natural enzymes of the grain (the amylases and the maltases) convert the starch to maltose and then to glucose.

The colour of a beer depends on the temperature used for this process: the higher the temperature, the darker the beer. In the next stage, mashing , the crushed grain is added to water at a specific temperature and any remaining starch is converted to sugar; the resultant liquid is the raw material of brewing, called wort. The yeast is then added to the wort to convert the sugar to alcohol, followed by hops, which give beer its characteristic flavour.

There may be a direct confrontation between competitors, as occurs between barnacles competing for space on a rock, or the numbers or fecundity of the competitors are indirectly reduced through joint dependence on limited resources. Competition occurs both between members of a species ( intraspecific competition ) and between different species ( interspecific competition ). Interspecific competition often results in the dominance of one species over another ( see dominant). Since competition ultimately results in the displacement by one competitor of the others, it is to the advantage of the competitors to avoid one another wherever possible. Thus in time the competitors become separated from each other geographically or ecologically, which promotes evolutionary change. Competition for mates may lead to *sexual selection.",

Mechanisms of flight have evolved mainly in birds, bats, and insects: these animals are adapted for flight by the presence of wings , which increases the ratio of surface area to body weight. Birds possess powerful flight muscles: the depressor muscle runs from the underside of the humerus to the sternum and is responsible for the downstroke of the wing; the levator muscle works antagonistically, producing the upstroke. Flight in insects works in a similar fashion but the muscles that control the wing movement are attached to the thorax. A few species of mammals, reptiles, and fish have developed flight to a lesser extent. For example, flying squirrels (order Dermoptera) possess a membrane attached to the limbs that can open and function as a parachute, allowing the animals to glide. 2. Part of a survival mechanism in an animal that is generated in response to a threatening situation.

  "wort": "The process by which beer is made. *Fermentation of sugars from barley grain by the yeasts * Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. uvarum (or S. carlsbergenesis ) produces alcohol (ethanol). In the first stage the barley grain is soaked in water, a process known as malting. The grain is then allowed to germinate and the natural enzymes of the grain (the amylases and the maltases) convert the starch to maltose and then to glucose. The next stage is kilning or roasting , in which the grains are dried and crushed. The colour of a beer depends on the temperature used for this process: the higher the temperature, the darker the beer. In the next stage, mashing , the crushed grain is added to water at a specific temperature and any remaining starch is converted to sugar; the resultant liquid is the raw material of brewing, called wort. The yeast is then added to the wort to convert the sugar to alcohol, followed by hops, which give beer its characteristic flavour.

The technique is used particularly in mammography, the examination of the infrared radiation emitted by human breasts in order to detect breast cancer.",
  "thermoluminescence": "Luminescence produced in a solid when its temperature is raised. It arises when free charge carriers, trapped in a solid as a result of exposure to ionizing radiation, unite and emit photons of light. The process is made use of in thermoluminescent dating , which assumes that the number of charge carriers trapped in a sample of pottery is related to the length of time that has elapsed since the pottery was fired. By comparing the luminescence produced by heating a piece of pottery of unknown age with the luminescence produced by heating similar materials of known age, a fairly accurate estimate of the age of an object can be made.",

There are also heritable or genetic polymorphisms , in which differences are the result of inherited characteristics. Two forms of genetic polymorphism exist: transient polymorphism , in which a particular form is in the process of spreading through a population, causing the relative proportion of phenotypes to alter; and balanced polymorphism , in which two or more forms coexist in a stable ratio within a population, each form possessing both advantageous and disadvantageous characteristics. An example of balanced polymorphism is the occurrence of sickle-cell anaemia , a genetic disease that principally affects Black populations of central Africa and is characterized by an abnormal form of the blood pigment haemoglobin ( haemoglobin S ) and sickle-shaped red blood cells. Three different types of individual occur in such populations: those who have two genes ( AA ) for normal haemoglobin and therefore do not suffer from the disease; those with one normal and one abnormal gene ( AS ), who suffer from a relatively mild form; and those with two abnormal genes ( SS ), who suffer a chronic and eventually fatal form of anaemia. Normally such a harmful gene would have been eliminated from the population by the process of natural selection, but it is maintained in this case because people with the mild form of the disease are resistant to a severe form of malaria endemic in central Africa.",

This limits the number of herbaceous plants and small shrubs that grow on the forest floor, but *epiphytes, vines, and creepers are abundant. The average temperature is about 27°C, which together with the high humidity encourages rapid decomposition of leaf litter, releasing minerals that replace those leached from the soil by the heavy rain. If the forest canopy is removed, the soil is destroyed rapidly due to leaching by rain.
